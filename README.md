# latex_templates

These are some LaTeX templates that I use regularly. I've included the zipfiles for download.

# Licensing

The files are licensed under the LaTeX Project license. If you want to use them in your own work, I ask that you license your own files, and add attribution to me (Johanan Idicula) in the boilerplate. I also ask you to only distribute these files and their derivative works without charging any fee to the end user.
